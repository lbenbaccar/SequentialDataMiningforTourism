# Tourist's Tour Prediction by Sequential Data Mining Approach

We answer the problem of predicting future behaviour tourist based on past behaviour of an individual tourist. The individual behaviour is naturally an indicator of the behaviour of other tourists. The prediction of tourists movement has a crucial role in tourism marketing to create demand and assist tourists in decision-making. With advances in information and communication technology, social media platforms generate data from millions of people from different countries during their travel. The main objective of this paper is to consider sequential
data-mining methods to predict tourist movement based on Instagram data. Rules emerge from those ones are exploited to predict future behaviors. The originality of this approach is a combination between pattern mining to reduce the size of data and the automata to condense the rules. The capital city of France, Paris is selected to demonstrate the utility of the proposed methodology.
